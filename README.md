This is a productivity timer inspired by the Pomodoro Technique. It provides a framework for committing to specific work and break periods to reduce distractions and improve time management.

GSD follows the traditional Pomodoro method using standardized 25-minute work periods accompanied by set breaks. After each completed work session you can take a 5-min break. Complete 4 work sessions and you get to take a longer 15-min break.
